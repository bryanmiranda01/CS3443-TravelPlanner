Description
A simple travel planning application that will allow a user to consolidate all the information they may need when preparing for a trip. The main feature of this app will allow the user to create a trip itinerary that will allow them to list which activities they want to complete.

There will also be a calendar implemented that will allow the user to view their trip and planned events over multiple days. Within the trip itinerary, the user will be able to set priorities for different activities using a color-coded system. They will also be able to set up reminders for during their trip that will notify them of time blocks allocated for certain activities. Other possible features include a budget planner to allow the user to allocate funds to different activities and an integrated map for the user.
